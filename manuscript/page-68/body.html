Does one man do them harm and all the world good? Is not the exact opposite the truth? One man is able to do them good, or at least not many;&mdash;the trainer of horses, that is to say, does them good, and others who have to do with them rather injure them? Is not that true, Meletus, of horses, or of any other animals? Most assuredly it is; whether you and Anytus say yes or no. Happy indeed would be the condition of youth if they had one corrupter only, and all the rest of the world were their improvers.</p></div> </div>
