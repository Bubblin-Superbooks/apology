<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The difficulty, my friends, is not to avoid death, but to avoid unrighteousness; for that runs faster than death. I am old and move slowly, and the slower runner has overtaken me, and my accusers are keen and quick, and the faster runner, who is unrighteousness, has overtaken them. And now I depart hence condemned by you to suffer the penalty of death,&mdash;they too go their ways condemned by the truth to suffer the penalty of villainy and wrong; and I must abide by my award&mdash;let them abide by theirs. I suppose that these things may be regarded as fated,&mdash;and I think that they are well.</p><p>And now, O men who have condemned me, I would fain prophesy to you; for I am about to die, and in the hour of death men are gifted with prophetic power.</p></div> </div>
