<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I will answer to you and to the court, as you refuse to answer for yourself. There is no man who ever did. But now please to answer the next question: Can a man believe in spiritual and divine agencies, and not in spirits or demigods?</p><p>He cannot.</p><p>How lucky I am to have extracted that answer, by the assistance of the court! But then you swear in the indictment that I teach and believe in divine or spiritual agencies (new or old, no matter for that); at any rate, I believe in spiritual agencies,&mdash;so you say and swear in the affidavit; and yet if I believe in divine beings, how can I help believing in spirits or demigods;&mdash;must I not? To be sure I must; and therefore I may assume that your silence gives consent. Now what are spirits or demigods? Are they not either gods or the sons of gods?</p></div> </div>
